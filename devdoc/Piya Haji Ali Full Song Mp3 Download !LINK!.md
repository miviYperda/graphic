## The History of Haji Ali Dargah
 
The Haji Ali Dargah dates back to 1431 and is affiliated with Sayyed Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. He was a prosperous trader from Bukhara (modern-day Uzbekistan) who forsook his wealth and worldly belongings to travel to Mecca for the pilgrimage. Following that, he traveled the globe before settling in Mumbai.
 
According to legend, he once saw a poor woman crying on the road because she had spilled the oil she was carrying and feared her husband's wrath. He miraculously made oil gush out from the ground by poking his finger into the soil and helped the woman fill her vessel. However, he later had a disturbing dream that he had injured the earth by his act and felt remorseful. He became ill and asked his mother's permission to go to India with his brother. He also wrote a letter to his mother informing her of his decision to stay in Mumbai and spread Islam.
 
Before his death, he instructed his followers not to bury him in any proper place or graveyard, but to drop his shroud in the ocean and let it find a resting place by itself. His wish was followed and his shroud was found on a small island off the coast of Worli. The dargah was built at that spot in his memory and honor.
