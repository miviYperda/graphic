## What are PLT and DXF files?
 
PLT and DXF are two common file formats used in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) applications. PLT stands for Plotter File, which is a vector-based format that contains instructions for drawing lines, curves, shapes, and text on a plotter device. DXF stands for Drawing Exchange Format, which is a universal format that can store both vector and raster data, and can be opened by various CAD programs.
 
Converting PLT files to DXF files can be useful for several reasons. For example, you may want to edit your PLT files in a different CAD program that supports DXF format, or you may want to share your PLT files with someone who does not have a plotter device or a PLT viewer. By converting your PLT files to DXF files, you can ensure compatibility and accessibility of your CAD data.
