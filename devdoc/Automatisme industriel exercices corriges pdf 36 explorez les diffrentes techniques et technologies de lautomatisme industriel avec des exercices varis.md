# Summon Night Swordcraft Story 3: A Fan Translation Project
 
Summon Night Swordcraft Story 3 is a role-playing game developed by Flight-Plan and published by Banpresto for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. It is the third installment in the Summon Night Swordcraft Story series, which is a spin-off of the main Summon Night series. The game follows the adventures of a young Craftknight who can forge weapons and summon creatures called Guardians.
 
The game was never officially released outside Japan, but a fan translation project has been ongoing for years. The project was started by Ritchburn, who translated most of the script before leaving. The project was then taken over by Pablitox, who assembled a team of hackers, translators, proofreaders, and graphic artists to finish the job. The project faced many challenges and setbacks, such as hackers and translators leaving, technical limitations, and script issues.

However, thanks to the help of unknownbrackets, an ASM hacker who created a script inserter that can handle every possible outcome, the project has made significant progress. The team is now able to fully insert the translated script into the game, and they are working on proofreading and polishing it. They also have a new website where they post updates and screenshots of their work.
 
The latest update from the team was on October 31st, 2022, where they announced that they have reached patch 35. This patch fixes some bugs and glitches, improves some graphics and fonts, and adds some missing text. The team also said that they are very close to finishing the project, and they hope to release the final patch soon.
 
The fan translation project of Summon Night Swordcraft Story 3 is a testament to the dedication and passion of the fans who love this game. They have spent countless hours and resources to bring this game to English-speaking audiences who would otherwise never get to play it. They have also created a community of fans who support and encourage each other. The project is not only a translation, but also a tribute to the original developers and their work.
