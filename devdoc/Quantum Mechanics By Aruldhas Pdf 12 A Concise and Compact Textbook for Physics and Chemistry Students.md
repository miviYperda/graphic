# Quantum Mechanics By Aruldhas Pdf 12: A Review of a Popular Textbook on Quantum Physics
 
Quantum mechanics is one of the most fascinating and challenging branches of physics, dealing with the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales. It is also one of the most difficult subjects to learn and master, requiring a high level of mathematical and conceptual skills. Many students struggle with the abstract and counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics, such as wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, superposition, entanglement, and measurement problem.

One of the books that aims to help students overcome these difficulties is *Quantum Mechanics* by G. Aruldhas, a former professor and head of physics department at the University of Kerala, India. The book, which is now in its second edition, was published by PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd. in 2008[^1^]. It offers a concise and compact introduction to the basic principles of quantum mechanics and their applications to various physical and chemical problems. The book is designed as a textbook for postgraduate and advanced undergraduate courses in physics and chemistry.
 
The book consists of 14 chapters, covering topics such as mathematical preliminaries, postulates of quantum mechanics, Schrodinger equation, angular momentum, perturbation theory, variational method, scattering theory, identical particles, spin, approximation methods for many-electron atoms, molecular structure and spectra, field quantization, and chemical bonding. Each chapter contains a summary of key concepts, worked examples, exercises, and references. The book also provides a solutions manual containing the solutions to chapter-end exercises[^1^].
 
The book has received positive reviews from students and teachers who have used it as a reference or a course material. Some of the strengths of the book are its clear and concise explanations, its rigorous and logical presentation, its use of relevant examples and applications, its balance between theory and practice, and its coverage of both classical and modern aspects of quantum mechanics. Some of the weaknesses of the book are its occasional typos and errors, its lack of color illustrations and diagrams, its omission of some advanced topics such as relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, and its high price compared to other similar books.
